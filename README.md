#GuestByte

This is the start of an event planning app, built with Ruby on Rails as part of
[Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/) code school.

Before running the app, run `bundle install` to install the necessary gems, `rake db:create` to
create your database, and then `rake db:schema:load` to load the database schema.

To use the app, run `rails s` from the project directory and visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Or, find it hosted at http://guest-byte.herokuapp.com/
